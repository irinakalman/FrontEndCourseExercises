        <p>An internet was invented in USA in the 1960s. It was used only by government institutions as Military and
            Universities to share information. The computers were massive and unaffordable machines. There was a need to
            create an interconnected network of computers between USA and international academic researchers. The
            official
            birthday of the Internet is on the 1st of January 1983. Before there was no standard protocol for connecting
            and
            communication between each other. However, Transfer Control Protocol (TCP) or Internet Protocol(IP) was
            invented. Below you can see the first commercial computer "UNIVAC I". It was invented in 1951 and it could
            do
            around 1000 calculations per second</p>

        <h2>How does the Internet work</h2>
        <p class="network">
            The Internet is the large network of computers that are connected to each other and can communicate between
            each
            other. We also use routers that are like computers and let us connect local computers to one another. There
            was
            a need for another infrastructure that will be connected to the rest of the world. That is when the
            telephone
            line started to be used for that. The telephone line is used to connect with the rest of the world by using
            modem which helps us to do that. The modem equipment helps the information to be transferred and transformed
            to
            telephone line and vice versa.
        </p>
        <p>
            There is another network that is used which called Internet Service Provider (ISP). This network has
            special
            routers that can access other IP's. That is where we send our information, then it it sent by ISP to the
            specific IP that we intend to send.

    <!-- Internet Protocols -->
    <div id="protocols" class="internet_protocols">
        <h2>Internet Protocols</h2>
        <p> Each computer has its own specific address which is named Internet Protocol(IP) by which it can be
            identified on
            the Internet. The IP address is a string of number which are separated by periods. The IP address is
            assigned to
            each computer by its ISP. The first major version of the IP is IPv4 (Internet Protocol Version). It is the
            most
            popular version of the Internet. Another version which started on 2006 is IPv6. The difference between them
            is
            the size of the address.
        </p>

    <!-- IP addresses -->
    <div id="ip_addresses" class="ip">
        <h2>IP addresses</h2>
        <p>
            There are different types and categories of IP addresses. Everyone who uses internet service plan has
            private IP
            address and Public. Private IP is visible only locally, it is not shared to the rest of the world. Usually
            routers generate those IP addresses for every device that tries to connect locally in order to differentiate
            them. On the other hand, public IP address is visible to the rest of the world. It is provided by ISP.

        <h2>DNS</h2>
        <p>
            Real IP addresses are hard to remember for people, that is why DNS(Domain Name Servers) was created. It is
            like
            a phone book for the Internet. People try to access website by domain names and the DNS is looking for their
            actual IP address. How does it work? First, we type the domain name in our browser. The browser checks the
            computer(local cache) if it knows this name. If it doesn't, it goes to ask the DNS server.

    <!-- Packets (tcp/udp) -->
    <div id="_packets" class="packets">
        <h2>Packets (TCP/UDP)</h2>
        <p>
            In order to send the data between computer, it is transformed into packets so that it can be sent and load
            fast.
            The packets are sent separately and travel from router to router until they reach their destination. It does
            not
            matter in which order they will be sent, they just must all arrive on time. You can read more <a class="link"
                href="https://www.cs.ait.ac.th/~on/O/oreilly/tcpip/firewall/ch06_01.htm">about Packets here</a>

        <p>
            TCP and UDP are the protocols that are used in order to send those packets across the internet to the
            receiver.
            TCP(Transmission Control Protocol) is one of the main protocols of the Internet. It is connection-oriented
            which
            means it will first establish connection between computer and server and then it will start sending packets.
            TCP
            has reliable, error-checking and ordered delivery of packets. UDP(User Datagram Protocol) is one of main
            protocols too. However, it does not provide reliable data stream. It is used mostly for video-streaming and
            gaming.

    <!-- routers -->
    <div id="_routers" class="routers">
        <h2>Routers</h2>
        <p>
            Router is a networking device that sends the data between computer networks. It has two functions such as
            managing traffic and let multiple devices use the same network. There are many types of routers. The major
            ones
            are LANs(Local Area Network) and WANs(Wide Area Network). LAN is usually restricted to specific area and WAN
            is
            distributed across bigger area. Big companies are using WAN.

        <h2>HTTP</h2>
        <p>
            HTTP(Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the foundation of the World Wide Web. It was created by Tim Berners-Lee
            at
            CERN in 1989. It is loading pages using hypertext links. It also functions as request-response between
            clients
            and servers. The client(user agent) sends an HTTP request to the server in order to get a page, in return it
            gets the status code, for example: "404"(Not Found) or "200" (OK).

        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <p>
            HTML(Hyper Text Markup Language) is the language of all webpages on the Internet. HTML describes the
            structure
            of the webpage, where each HTML element is the building block of that page. It helps to create attractive
            websites
            using along CSS(Cascading Style Sheets) and scripting language as a Javascript. HTML consists of HTML tags
            such
            as header, body, paragraphs and so on. HTML5 is the newest version of HTML.
