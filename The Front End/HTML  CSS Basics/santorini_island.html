      The famous volcano of Santorini is the most famous sightseeing on the

      coastline of Santorini. It is located on the island of Nea Kameni and many
      tour boats go there from Fira. On the neighboring island of Palea Kameni,
      there are the hot springs, which are said to have curative properties.

      The Minoan Town of Akrotiri is one of the most important ancient sites on
      Santorini and one of the famous things to see. It is located on the
      southern side of the island and the town was found almost intact, covered
      with layers of ashes. Scientists believe that this town was destroyed by
      the volcanic eruption of Santorini in about 1,650 BC. After many years of
      being closed down, the site reopened to visitors in April 2012. Read more
