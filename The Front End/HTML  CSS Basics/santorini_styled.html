      It is located on the island of Nea Kameni and many tour boats go there
      from Fira.<br /><br />
      On the neighboring island of Palea Kameni, there are the hot springs,
      which are said to have curative properties.<br /><br />

    <p>
      The Minoan Town of Akrotiri is one of the most important ancient sites on
      Santorini and one of the famous things to see.<br /><br />
      It is located on the southern side of the island and the town was found
      almost intact, covered with layers of ashes.<br /><br />
      Scientists believe that this town was destroyed by the volcanic eruption
      of Santorini in about 1,650 BC.<br /><br />
      After many years of being closed down, the site reopened to visitors in
      April 2012.<br /><br />
